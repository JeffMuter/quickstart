      <description>Weekly Dev Update&#xA;Arden Labs Golang in AI Webinar&#xA;This week I had a chance encounter! I was listening to &amp;lsquo;Cup O&amp;rsquo; Go&amp;rsquo; podcast, where Bill Kennedy mentioned some of the trainings that Ardan Lab does, which led to me seeing the Ardan Labs was sponsoring a free Webinar on how to use Golang to create AI services! So many of my side projects related to AI were shelved because of how commited I am to learning Golang.</description>

      <description>Weekly Dev Update Building a Web Server &amp;amp; Creating This Blog&#xA;Building a Golang Web Server from the ground up I turned a basic empty Golang project, into my first attempt at building a web server. This has been much harder than I thought. There is so much about building a Golang web server that is significantly different from the API&amp;rsquo;s I built in Java in the MVC design pattern. On top of learning new Go concepts, learning a new folder structure, the terms that go along with this kind of project has been seriously jarring.</description>
