      <description>Weekly Dev Update Creating Content &amp;amp; Developing User Registration Registration Form This week, what I spent the most time building was the continued work on my registration form. Returning to a sort of mid-level phase, adding sessions to a database, not stored locally in a map. This is nearly complete, but I hope to get that complete, and begin adding tests. I haven&amp;rsquo;t made database unit testing in Golang, so that&amp;rsquo;s something that really excites me.</description>

      <description>Simplifying Middleware in Go I want to discuss some of the discoveries, and challenges, I ran into while building a Golang http web server, and making the authentication part of the application. Since I have not been using any frameworks, the process does get a bit deep, far moreso, comparatively to the ease by which other frameworks and languages remove the technical details of an application via abstractions. However, I stand by the idea that understanding a process without abstractions, is the best way to approach bugs, foreign code(code you are unfamiliar with), and also helps you to pick up new concepts quickly when encountering something novel.</description>

      <description>Weekly Dev Update&#xA;Arden Labs Golang in AI Webinar&#xA;This week I had a chance encounter! I was listening to &amp;lsquo;Cup O&amp;rsquo; Go&amp;rsquo; podcast, where Bill Kennedy mentioned some of the trainings that Ardan Lab does, which led to me seeing the Ardan Labs was sponsoring a free Webinar on how to use Golang to create AI services! So many of my side projects related to AI were shelved because of how commited I am to learning Golang.</description>

      <description>Weekly Dev Update Building a Web Server &amp;amp; Creating This Blog&#xA;Building a Golang Web Server from the ground up I turned a basic empty Golang project, into my first attempt at building a web server. This has been much harder than I thought. There is so much about building a Golang web server that is significantly different from the API&amp;rsquo;s I built in Java in the MVC design pattern. On top of learning new Go concepts, learning a new folder structure, the terms that go along with this kind of project has been seriously jarring.</description>

      <description>Leadership in the AI Era Sean Erikson December 19th: some kind of holiday party. August 10th is Summerfest!&#xA;Bart Murphy: CIO @ OCLC &amp;ldquo;Hype Cycle of AI&amp;rdquo; OCLC is that library company that manages book data Highly concerned with ethics in AI How does OCLC handle knowing whether or not new book submissions are duplicates? Made a chatbot for managing tons of Jira tickets In customer service, LLM&amp;rsquo;s are a bit too expensive to properly replace customer service (long wait times with indexing vectorized data) Moving towards open source: oLlama, Llama3 : reduce cost Data curation is a big problem.</description>
