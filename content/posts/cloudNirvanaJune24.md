# Leadership in the AI Era

### Sean Erikson

December 19th: some kind of holiday party.
August 10th is Summerfest!

### Bart Murphy: CIO @ OCLC

"Hype Cycle of AI"
OCLC is that library company that manages book data
Highly concerned with ethics in AI
How does OCLC handle knowing whether or not new book submissions are duplicates?
Made a chatbot for managing tons of Jira tickets
In customer service, LLM's are a bit too expensive to properly replace customer service (long wait times with indexing vectorized data)
Moving towards open source: oLlama, Llama3 : reduce cost
Data curation is a big problem.
Don't underestimate engineering / maintenence cost of AI services.

### Pinak Barve : McGraw Hill : VP of Engineering

This company uses Go! :)
Learning Impact use cases: reading/writing coach, course builder, risk assessment reporting, 
Content creation use case: multi-modal content, metadata management, 
Productivity use cases: ai chatbot, multi agent workflows, copilot for coding productivity
A lot of concern over the value of copilot: I'm impressed to see this level of forward thinking on the topic.
Discerning whether ai needs to solve a problem, or whether existing tools, or added functionality can solve the issue.
Having AI knowledge base / experts can help elimainate people's concerns and confusions / wrong-steering.
RAG pattern has seen the best results. They haven't needed to go further.
Concern that the AI can use cultural terms & phrases that are offensive in different cultures.
learn the basics of embedding, determining the right way to vectorizing data, chinking, etc.. Good to know for myself.
RAG is being highly promoted, and this pattern was seen as highly hallucination resistant.

### Community Highlight: Maureen Metcalf : Junell Felsburg : FauxMo AI

I would say Maureen is fairly idealistic with predictions with technological advancements, and attributes these to AI, and I'm not 100% sure how the advancements she predicts are corelated to AI.

### Junell's presentation

an interesting point on how, games like the oregon trail, or dwarf fortress, how much control do we really have over our team? At some point, our team has more control than the manager. The manager becomes, instead of a itght control, a rudder that stears the ship, but the importance of the team becomes undeniable.
This is a sales pitch for a leadership course.

### Srini Koushik : Rackspace

Responsible AI with FAIR
Great person to talk to about doing AI projects
excited about 5 years AGI. Introduced himself by his age : 60 (mayhaps hopeful for life-enhancing tech evolutions)
technological advancements don't happen in a bubble. If things keep accellerating, it's too difficult for expert to keep up.
Focus on AI making us better at our jobs, not replacing people. 


### General Notes

A lot of conversations to try and remind people that AI is another technology, nothing magical, or needing to jump into new service building right now, without doing thorough research into what is actully going to save cose.

I want to work more with RAG ai service pattern, build some cool stuff, clones, chatbots, helpful things, etc.. It does sound like there are real
